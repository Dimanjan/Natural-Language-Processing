Londinium was founded by the Romans.[9] The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits.[10][11][12][13][14][note 1] The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status.

London exerts a considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation.[30][31] London ranks 26th out of 300 major cities for economic performance.[32] It is one of the largest financial centres[33] and has either the fifth or the sixth largest metropolitan area GDP.[note 3][34][35][36][37][38] It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals[39] and has the busiest city airport system as measured by passenger traffic.[40] It is the leading investment destination,[41][42][43][44] hosting more international retailers[45][46] and ultra high-net-worth individuals[47][48] than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe,[49] and London is home to highly ranked institutions such as Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London and King's College London.[50][51][52] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games.[53]\n",

        "\"London\" is an ancient name, already attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium;[62] for example, handwritten Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70-80 include the word Londinio (\"in London\").[63]\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the years, the name has attracted many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136.[62] This had it that the name originated from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud.[64]\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as *[Londonjon] or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into Old English, the ancestor-language of English.[65]\n",
        "\n",
        "The toponymy of the Common Brythonic form is much debated. A prominent explanation was Richard Coates' 1998 argument that the name derived from pre-Celtic Old European *(p)lowonida, meaning \"river too wide to ford\". Coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, *Lowonidonjon.[66] However, most work has accepted a Celtic origin for the name, and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a Celtic derivative of a Proto-Indo-European root *lendh- ('sink, cause to sink'), combined with the Celtic suffix *-injo- or *-onjo- (used to form place-names). Peter Schrijver has specifically suggested, on these grounds, that the name originally meant 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'.[67][65]\n",

From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[78]\n",

It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred \"refounded\" London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.[79]\n",

For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[86] Disaster struck in the form of the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population.[87] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[88]\n",

It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[92] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable.[93]\n",

Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity.[94] The Royal Exchange was founded.[95] Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World.

        "London, also referred to as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top-level subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis.[note 5] The small ancient City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes.[166]\n",

        "Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[167][168] The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.[169]\n",

        "Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt,[170] although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, resulting in a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[171] Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London.[172] The city is split by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area in its interior. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W.[173] However the geographical centre of London, on one definition, is in the London Borough of Lambeth, just 0.1 miles to the northeast of Lambeth North tube station.[174]\n",

        "Its position was formed through constitutional convention, making its status as de facto capital a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.[180] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London.[13]\n",

        "Greater London encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres (611 sq mi), an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760/sq mi). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi).[181] Modern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[182]\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[183] The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles (up in Scotland and Northern Ireland and down in southern parts of England, Wales and Ireland) caused by post-glacial rebound.[184][185]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.[186]\n",

The temperature was recorded at 105 °F (40.6 °C) on 13 July. It is thought that this temperature, if accurate, is one of the highest temperatures of the millennium in the United Kingdom. It is thought that only days in 1513 and 1707 could have beaten this.[196] Since records began in London (first at Greenwich in 1841[197]), the warmest month on record is July 1868, with a mean temperature of 22.5 °C (72.5 °F) at Greenwich whereas the coldest month is December 2010, with a mean temperature of −6.7 °C (19.9 °F) at Northolt.[198] Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,050 millibars (31 inHg) on 20 January 2020 and the lowest is 945.8 millibars (27.93 inHg) on 25 December 1821.[199][200]\n",

On average each year, London experiences 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F) every year. During the 2003 European heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above 30 °C (86.0 °F) and 2 consecutive days when temperatures reached 38 °C (100 °F), leading to hundreds of heat-related deaths.[201] There was also a previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 °C (90.0 °F) in 1976 which also caused many heat related deaths.[202] The previous record high was 38 °C (100 °F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station.[197] Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer. Most recently in Summer 2018[203] and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December.[204] However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.[205]\n",

Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City.

Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth II's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along.

London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance.[286][287] London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.[112] This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI),[288] and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.[289]\n",

Pahad is the mountain region that does not generally contain snow. The mountains vary from 800 to 4,000 metres (2,600 to 13,100 ft) in altitude, with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) to alpine climates above 3,600 metres (11,800 ft). The Lower Himalayan Range, reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres (4,900 to 9,800 ft), is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and \"hills\" alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) and very low above 2,500 metres (8,200 ft), where snow occasionally falls in winter. The southern lowland plains or Terai bordering India are part of the northern rim of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Terai is the lowland region containing some hill ranges. The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the Koshi, the Narayani, and the Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of the foothills called Sivalik Hills or Churia Range, cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres (2,300 to 3,280 ft), marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain; however broad, low valleys called Inner Terai Valleys (Bhitri Tarai Upatyaka) lie north of these foothills in several places.\n",

        "    A dal - bhat thali with boiled rice, lentil soup, fried leafy greens, vegetable curry, yoghurt, papad and vegetable salad Nepalese cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines.Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit. [301] Nepali foodways have been influenced by religion, in particular Hindu and Buddhist cultural choices and traditions.The Columbian exchange had brought the potato, the tomato, maize, peanuts, cashew nuts, pineapples, guavas, and most notably, chilli peppers, to South Asia.Each became staples of use. [302] The cereals grown in Nepal, their choice, times, and regions of planting, correspond strongly to the timing of Nepal 's monsoons,[303] and the variations in altitude. Rice and wheat are mostly cultivated in the terai plains and well-irrigated valleys, and maize, millet, barley and buckwheat in the lesser fertile and drier hills.[301][304]\n",

        "    Momo dumplings with chutney The foundation of a typical Nepali meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion, and complemented with flavorful savory dishes. [305] The latter includes lentils, pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic, but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon, jimbu and others as informed by culinary conventions. [305] In an actual meal, this mental representation takes the form of a platter, or thali, with a central place\n",
        "    for the cooked cereal, peripheral ones, often in small bowls,\n",
        "    for the flavorful accompaniments, and the simultaneous, rather than piecemeal, ingestion of the two in each act of eating, whether by actual mixing—\n",
        "    for example of rice and lentils— or in the folding of one— such as bread— around the other, such as cooked vegetables. [305] Dal - bhat, centred around steamed rice, which is accompanied by lentil soup, vegetable curries, chutneys and pickle, [306] as well as dairy and sometimes meat, is the most common and prominent example.The unleavened flat bread made from wheat flour called chapati occasionally replaces the steamed rice, particularly in the Terai,\n",
        "    while Dhindo, prepared by boiling corn, millet or buckwheat flour in water, continuously stirring and adding flour until thick, almost solid consistency is reached, is the main substitute\n",
        "    for rice in the hills and mountains.Tsampa, flour made from roasted barley and naked barley, is the main staple in the high himalayas.Fermented, then sun - dried, leafy greens called Gundruk are both a delicacy and a vital substitute\n",

        "    A notable feature of Nepali food is the existence of a number of distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents. [307] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in South Asian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of Nepal 's Hindu and Buddhist populations, as well as among Jains.[307] Among these groups, strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat.[308] Though per capita meat consumption is low in Nepal, the proportion of vegetarianism is not high as that of India, due to the prevalence of Shaktism, of which animal sacrifice is a prominent feature.\n",

        "    Samayabaji(Newar cuisine) Although overshadowed by the Indian and Tibetan cuisines in the global consciousness, [309] Nepali cuisines possess their own distinctive qualities to distinguish these hybrid cuisines from both their northern and southern neighbours. [306] Nepali cuisines, with generally tomato - based, leaner curries, are lighter than their cream - based Indian counterparts, and Nepali momo dumplings are heavily spiced compared to their northern counterparts. [306] Newar cuisine, one of the richest and most influential in Nepal, is more elaborate and diverse than most, as Newar culture developed in the highly fertile Kathmandu valley, and Newar people have historically been more well - travelled and affluent than others. [301] A typical Newar cuisine can comprise more than a dozen dishes of cereals, meat, vegetable curries, chutneys and pickles.Kwanti(sprouted beans soup), chhwela(ground beef), chatamari, (rice flour crepe), bara(fried lentil cake), kachila(marinated raw minced beef), samaybaji(centred around flattened rice), lakhaamari and yomuri are among the more widely recognised. [306][310] Juju dhau, a sweet yoghurt originating in Bhaktapur, is also famous. [306] Thakali cuisine is another well - known food tradition which seamlessly melds the Tibetan and the Indian with variety in ingredients, especially the herbs and spices. [301] Thukpa, a ramen dish originating in Tibet, is enlivened with beef and vegetables and spiced with Garam masala and chili peppers. [306] In the Terai, Bagiya is a rice flour dumpling with sweets inside, popular among the Tharu and Maithil people.Various communities in the Terai make sidhara(sun - dried small fish mixed with taro leaves) and biriya(lentil paste mixed with taro leaves) to stock\n",
        "    for the monsoon floods. [301] Selroti, kasaar, fini and chaku are among the sweet delicacies.Rice pulau or sweet rice porridge called kheer are usually the main dish in feasts. [304] Tea and buttermilk(fermented milk leftover from churning butter from yoghurt) are common non - alcoholic drinks.Almost all janajati communities have their own traditional methods of brewing alcohol.Raksi(traditional distilled alcohol), jaand(rice beer), tongba(millet beer) and chyaang are the most well - known.In the hilly regions, various janajatis hunt stream - frogs known as Pahas. [311] In the eastern hills, Kirat people make yangben faska by cooking lichen known as yangben with pork. [301] In the Terai, Tharu cuisines includes dishes of rats, mussels and snails. [301][312] Rats are also hunted and eaten by the Musahar community in the Terai, whose name literally translates to rat - eaters.\n",
